0x01. Caching

Key concepts:
	Cache replacement policies/ cache replacement algorithms/ cache algorithms
	cache, latency, hit ratio
	Other secondary factors affecting cache performance
	average memory reference time

	Bélády's Anomaly in Page Replacement Algorithms: Random replacement (RR)
        Simple queue-based policies: FIFO, LIFO/FILO, SIEVE
	Simple recency-based policies: LRU, Time-aware LRU, MRU, SLRU, LRU approximations,
				PLRU, Clock-Pro
	Simple frequency-based policies: LFU, LFRU, LFUDA, S3-FIFO,
	RRIP-style policies: RRIP, SRRIP, BRRIP, DRRIP
	Policies approximating Bélády's algorithm: Hawkeye, Mockingjay
	Machine-learning policies
	Other policies: LIRS, Adaptive replacement cache, Clock with adaptive replacement,
				Multi-queue, Pannier, 
	Cache replacement policies - FIFO
	Cache replacement policies - LIFO
	Cache replacement policies - LRU
	Cache replacement policies - MRU
	Cache replacement policies - LFU

	Basic dictionary, FIFO caching, LIFO caching, LRU Caching, MRU Caching, LFU Caching
	Static analysis

Main Learning Objectives:
	What a caching system is
	What FIFO means
	What LIFO means
	What LRU means
	What MRU means
	What LFU means
	What the purpose of a caching system
	What limits a caching system have

Functions:
	self.cache_data
